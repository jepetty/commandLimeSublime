# Contributing

## Code of Conduct
Please be nice! We like compliments here. Mostly we're all just here to learn and grow and do cool stuff.

## Branch Organization
Please fork the original project repository and develop your additions or changes in your own branch. We expect that all merge conflicts will be resolved before any attempts to merge into master are made. Additionally, we expect that no pull requests include a breaking change of any kind. 

## Bugs and Requests
We invite you to submit any bugs or feature requests! We also invite any changes that implement a feature request or resolve a bug. Thanks for your help!
